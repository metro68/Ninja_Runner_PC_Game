The Ninja Runner is a game designed for PC and mobile phones on all platforms.

I worked on it with a group of 5 programmers as the Lead Graphics Designer and Writer.

My task mainly involved using Unity Software to make efficient deisgns for the platform and coming up with ideas for obstacles in the game.

The code was written mainly in C#.
