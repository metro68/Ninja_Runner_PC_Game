# Ninja_Runner_PC_Game

The Ninja Runner is a game designed for PC and mobile phones on all platforms.

I worked on it with a group of 5 programmers as the Lead Graphics Designer and Writer.

Alongside helping with the code, my main task involved using Unity Software to make efficient deisgns for the platform and coming up with the storyline for the game.

The code was written mainly in C#.

The project was too large to go on Github and can be found at http://bit.ly/Ninjarunner
